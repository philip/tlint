## Tighten linter

This is an ALPHA release under active development of a linter for the Tighten-specific development conventions for Laravel code. By @loganhenson.

> not psr stuff, these are conventions agreed upon by Tighten developers
> intended for use alongside default php-cs-fixer (to cover aforementioned psr stuff)

## Install (Requires php7.1+)
```
composer global require loganhenson/tlint
```
> If you have other globally installed core laravel files you may need to update them to test this package.
> - laravel/valet
> - psy/psysh

## Usage
For entire project (you must pass the lint command to use other options)
```
tlint
```
For individual files and specific directories
```
tlint lint routes/ViewWithOverArrayParamatersExample.php
```

You can also lint only diff files by
```
tlint lint --diff
```
OR
```
tlint lint src --diff
```

> output
```
